NAME
     xmirror â€“ Interactive script for changing XBPS mirrors

SYNOPSIS
     xmirror [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
     The xmirror utility sets and resets the mirror server that XBPS uses.  It
     can be used both with and without the interactive TUI.  xmirror requires
     root permissions to execute.

OPTIONS
   Common
     -h, --help
         Show help and exit.

     -r, --rootdir rootdir
         Use an alternative rootdir.  Acts similar to XBPS's -r flag.

     -v, --version
         Show the version and exit.

   Interactive
     These options only work when using the interactive TUI.

     -l, --mirror-list mirrorlist
         Use an alternative mirrorlist file. This should be in the format
         described in FILES.  Default: /usr/share/xmirror/mirrors.lst

     -n, --no-fetch
         Don't attempt to update the mirror list.

   Non-Interactive
     Using these options skips the interactive TUI.

     -d, --default
         Reset the current mirror to the default and exit.

     -s, --set mirrorurl
         Set the current mirror to mirrorurl and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
     xmirror respects all environment variables xbps-install(1) uses when
     synchronizing repository indexes after selecting or resetting mirrors.

     XBPS_ARCH is particularly useful if setting the mirror on a system of a
     different architecture.

FILES
     /usr/share/xmirror/mirrors.lst is where the current mirror list is
     stored. It is a tab-separated value file, with the columns:

     region    A continent abbreviation from
               https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Abbreviations, World, or
               another string describing the region of the mirror.

     url       The base url of the mirror, for example:
               https://repo-default.voidlinux.org/

     location  A human-readable location for the mirror, like a country and/or
               city.

     tier      An indicator of status.

     All lines beginning with # are ignored.
